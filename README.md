<h1 align="center">Hey, there, my name is Ayman. 👋</h1>

## 🐻 About me ##
I love building clear and responsive websites that actually get the job done. 

## 💰 Career ## 
I've been working as a freelance web developer, making websites for people since 2021. It's never been my main job, it's been something on the side.

Originally, I started building on Shopify, then I moved on to WordPress, and from there, I started learning custom code.

## 🚀 What I'm working on ##
Working in the casino industry made me realise how harmful gambling websites can be for people. I decided I want to use my skills to make a positive change in the world, and so I'm building a downloadable application for PC's that will be able to block access to all gambling websites.
